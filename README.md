# CNNArchitectureDesign
Project for my Bachelor's Thesis in Computer Science.

## Designing Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Metastatic Tissue in the Lymph Nodes
### Evaluation of the Effect of Feature Map Distributions Across Convolutional Layers on Network Performance

This project was developed to answer to some extent the question: how does an Artificial Neural Network's (ANN) architecture design affect its performance? 
A more specific question that it gets closer to answering could be: how does the distribution of feature maps across convolutional layers affect the [metastatic tissue] image classification performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?

For a more detailed explanation of the project and its outcomes, refer to abstarct or the full report added in the repository.
